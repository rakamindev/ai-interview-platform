      <<~PROMPT
        You are evaluating a completed skills assessment interview to produce a structured skill portfolio.

        ROLE BEING ASSESSED: #{assessment.name}

        SKILL DEFINITIONS AND BEHAVIORAL ANCHORS:
        #{skills_text}

        UNIVERSAL L1-L5 ANCHORS (use for discovered skills):
        L1 — Executes with explicit guidance and close review. Understands conceptually but cannot apply independently.
        L2 — Executes independently on routine scope. Uses known patterns. Handles common cases but not edge cases.
        L3 — Executes complex, ambiguous scope. Makes tradeoffs. Handles edge cases. Can teach L1-L2.
        L4 — Defines standards and creates reusable systems. Resolves systemic problems. Cross-team impact.
        L5 — Org-level authority. Shapes how the skill is practiced. Rare.

        FINAL COVERAGE MAP:
        #{coverage_json}

        FULL INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT:
        #{transcript_text}

        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        TASK
        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

        For EACH skill in the coverage map (both configured and discovered):

        1. FIND THE EVIDENCE
           Read all transcript turns where this skill was discussed.
           Identify the 2-3 most revealing quotes from the CANDIDATE (not the AI).
           A quote is revealing if it shows HOW they think, not just WHAT they know.

        2. ASSIGN A LEVEL
           Compare the candidate's actual behavior to the L1-L5 anchors.
           Assign the highest level where you see CONSISTENT evidence, not just one strong moment.
           If evidence is mixed (mostly L2 with one L3 moment), assign L2.

        3. WRITE THE COMPETENCY SUMMARY
           2-3 sentences. Focus on patterns, not individual answers.
           What does this person reliably do at this skill? What's the ceiling? What's missing?

        4. ASSIGN CONFIDENCE
           high — probe_count >= 3 AND state = covered
           medium — probe_count = 2 OR state = partial
           low — probe_count <= 1 OR state = initiated
